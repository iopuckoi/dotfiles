To use pyenv to make a virtual environment (assuming pyenv installed).
- pyenv virtualenv <python_version> <python_version>_<project_name> // use - instead of _ in "project_name", ex - my-project, not my_project
- pyenv local <version created above>

Todo:
- create own project which can be used to install all setup dependencies and whatnot for a new Python project, and set a workspace's .vscode folder?
- maybe just have a script like the following...
  - new_project.py project_name python_version
    - run pyenv virtualblah from the top of this file
    - set local pyenv
    - maybe have some setup.py with all necessary dependencies?
      - black
      - isort
      - flake8
      - pylint
      - etc?
    - pull all files from a git repo that have basic .vscode stuff (.isort, .env, etc)
    - have script fill out missing settings and then plop in project/.vscode
